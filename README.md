# Summer_IST495
Real-time dictionary-based sentiment analysis for news headlines (IST 495 Internship)

**Intern: Qasim Ansari**

## Project Overview

This internship project focuses on developing a real-time, dictionary-based sentiment analyzer specifically designed to evaluate news headlines. Unlike many sentiment tools that rely on pretrained models, this system emphasizes interpretability and adaptability, learning and updating in real-time through a custom-built sentiment dictionary.

The project will also include a visual dashboard that displays sentiment trends across time, categories (sports or economic news, not sure yet), and topics. This dashboard will help surface patterns in public tone as reflected in headline language.

## Project Objectives

1. **Build a Real-Time Sentiment Scoring Engine**  
   Create Python scripts that absorb and preprocess incoming news headlines, apply dictionary-based sentiment logic, and assign sentiment scores (either positive, negative, or neutral).

2. **Develop and Maintain a Custom Dictionary**  
   Work iteratively to expand, tune, and refine a word-score dictionary based on real-world feedback and test results. Adjust for domain-specific terms.

3. **Design a Visual Dashboard (Jupyter/Streamlit)**  
   Build an interactive dashboard that allows sorting/filtering by score, date, or topic. Users should be able to explore sentiment patterns and outliers in headline tone over time.
